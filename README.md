# My TypeScript ToDo-List

This is a simple TODO-list application built with TypeScript. It allows users to:

- **Add new tasks:** Users can input new tasks with descriptions.
- **Mark tasks as complete:** Check off tasks that have been finished.
- **Edit existing tasks:** Update task descriptions if needed.
- **Delete tasks:** Remove tasks from the list.
- **Filter tasks:** View all tasks, only completed tasks, or only active tasks.
- **Local Storage persistence:** Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the browser is closed.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript:** For type safety and improved code maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For easier styling with a robust framework.

2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Open `dist/index.html` in your browser.

This project is a great starting point for learning TypeScript and building basic web applications. You can expand on this foundation by adding more features, implementing different design patterns, and exploring other front-end technologies.
